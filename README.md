A lightweight 3D kart racing prototype built with **JMonkeyEngine 3 (JME3)**.  
This project demonstrates real-time rendering, vehicle physics, and environment interaction in a 3D Java-based game engine.

---

## 📦 Overview

**JME3 Fast Kart** is a sandbox-style prototype that focuses on learning and experimentation with:
- Scene graph and terrain rendering
- Vehicle physics via `com.jme3.bullet` physics engine
- Materials and textures for terrain, vehicles, and water
- Camera chase systems and player input handling
- Real-time lighting, shading, and particle effects

The goal of this project is to serve as a hands-on learning environment for 3D game development using Java and JMonkeyEngine.

## 🧩 Features

- 🏁 **Drivable Kart** using JME’s built-in physics vehicle system  
- 🌄 **Custom Assets** for terrain, lighting, and materials  
- 🕹️ **Configurable Input Bindings** for keyboard and gamepad  
- 💧 **Realistic Rendering Effects** (water shaders, SSAO, normal/specular maps)  
- 🔊 **Audio & Particle Effects** (engine sounds, smoke trails, explosions)  
- 🧠 **Modular Java Source Structure** for easy extension and experimentation
